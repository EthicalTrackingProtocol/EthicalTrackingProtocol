# Open Tracking Protocol

The Open Tracking Protocol is the open and privacy-first standard for tracking visitor and user interaction on the internet.

Our mission is to contribute technology to an open internet which respects the privacy of its users by design.

## The 3 principles of the Open Tracking Protocol

### 1. Transparency
This community project is open-source because we strongly believe that transparency is key when it comes to tracking visitor and user interaction. With this full transparency it is possible for everybody to see what data will be collected and what happens with it.

### 2. Less is more
Traditional tracking aimed to collect as much data as possible from any digital interaction. As a result, mass-surveillance became a standard of the internet. For most websites and use-cases, collecting less data is absolutely sufficient.

### 3. Distributed ownership
The Open Tracking Protocol aims to collect various technologies for interaction tracking and build a framework around them. We are making these technologies available to the public so that everybody can host their own tracking systems. Data lakes and other service providers can still build great business models around this ecosystem. They will just not be the gatekeepers to the technology itself.


## Status

The Open Tracking Protocol is in early beta. We are planning to release a full tracking framework until the end of 2022.

## Sponsors
The Open Tracking Protocol is supported by [Qreuz](https://qreuz.com).

We are looking for further sponsors and partners to this community project.

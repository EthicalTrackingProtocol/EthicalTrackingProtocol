# Tracking Parameter Classification [Ethical Tracking Protocol]
This classification aims to classify and cluster tracking parameters and datapoints in the context of the Ethical Tracking Protocol.

The goal of this classification is to create an overview and guideline for the privacy-friendly processing of different information.

#### This classification is no legal advice.
The Ethical Tracking Protocol is a project that aims to develop a privacy-first framework for collecting and processing traffic and engagement data.

Data privacy regulation around the world is diverse. This is *a technical and **not** a legal project*.

Therefore, the content of this project and this file is not meant as legal advice anywhere around the world.

Nevertheless, the ambition of the Ethical Tracking Protocol is to generate a framework that enables privacy for internet users by technology.

**The tracking parameter classification is work-in-progress**. If you find any law around the world which is more strict than our classification, please contribute by opening an issue here on Github or by leaving a comment. If you are aware of any parameters that we did not list, please do the same.

## Tracking Parameter Classification

### Explanation of classification

#### Terms
**Data controller**: the entity (person or organization) responsible for collecting/processing tracking data
**3rd party data processor**: the third-party entity (person or organization) responsible for processing the collected data

#### Privacy implications
Privacy implications shall provide a structured way to determine if a tracking parameter contains sensitive information.
| Privacy implication | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1st level personal data | Disclosed personal data which is already suitable to identify a person or virtual profile within the technical systems of the data controller |
| 2nd level personal data | Disclosed personal data which is suitable to identify a person or virtual profile within the technical systems of a 3rd party data processor |
| Complex data | Disclosed data *[generated from systems external to the data controller]* which may be suitable to identify a person or virtual profile under certain circumstances, especially if the set of data is small enough |
| Generic data | Disclosed data generated by the systems of the data controller |

#### Processing types
Depending on the implications for privacy, Ethical Tracking Protocol suggests different default processing types.
| Processing | Description |
| --- | --- |
| pass-through | collect and process the data without modification |
| obfuscate | irreversible modification of data to not reflect the original value anymore. still keep the original higher level result. Example: replace user agent with random value but keep the same device class information |
| hash | irreversible replacement of data with a hash that does not have any relation to the original value anymore |
| delete | ignore or delete parameter in data collection if possible. Otherwise delete the parameter or replace value with `NULL` as early as possible during processing.|
| ask for consent | ask visitor/user for explicit consent (e.g. *informed* opt-in) before accessing/collecting/processing the data |
| anonymize X octets | replace X octets in an IP address with zeros. Example for 2-octet anonymization: `192.168.1.1` > `192.168.0.0`


### Classification
| Parameter | Example | Privacy implications | ETP default processing |

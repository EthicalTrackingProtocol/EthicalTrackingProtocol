# Ethical Tracking Protocol

The Ethical Tracking Protocol is the open and privacy-first standard for monitoring traffic and engagement on the internet.

Our mission is to contribute technology to an open internet which respects the privacy of its users by design.

## The 3 principles of the Ethical Tracking Protocol

### 1. Transparency
This community project is open-source because we strongly believe that transparency is key when it comes to tracking website traffic and engagement. With this full transparency it is possible for internet users to see what data will be collected and what happens with it.

### 2. Less is more
Traditional tracking aimed to collect as much data as possible from any digital interaction. As a result, mass-surveillance became a standard of the internet. The Ethical Tracking Protocol doesn't want to ban tracking visitor engagement and customer profiles. However, our approach follows the idea to 'measure what matters' in contrast to the old rule to 'measure everything'.

### 3. Distributed ownership
The Ethical Tracking Protocol aims to collect various technologies for traffic measurement and interaction tracking to build a framework around them. We are making these technologies available to the public so that everybody can host their own monitoring systems.


## Status

The Ethical Tracking Protocol is in early beta. We are planning to release a full monitoring framework until the end of 2022.
